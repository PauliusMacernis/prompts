Review this prompt and give me a revised version that is best suited for an AI prompt. Prompt:  
\[prompt\]

Ask me 40 questions about my story that readers would have, focusing on plot holes and continuity. The story:  
\[story\]  

Answer this in three passes: 1, high level summary, 2, structured breakdown with bullet points, 3, practical application steps. Keep each pass distinct.  

Teach me <blank> using the Socratic Method. Use first-principle thinking where reasonable.  

Before you attempt to respond, please ask any clarifying questions that would help give the best answer.  

Ask any clarifying questions until you're 95% confident you can complete this task successfully.  

Iterate it three times. Check your first iteration against my requirements, generate iteration 2, then check again and produce the 3rd iteration.

Important Instructions for File Updates:

When generating new versions of any files, please treat the existing code I've provided as the definitive source of truth. Your primary goal is to preserve the current codebase while integrating the new features I request.

Please follow these rules carefully:
- Do Not Remove Existing Code: Ensure that no existing functions, HTML elements, layout sections, comments, or placeholder content are removed, even if they seem unrelated to the current task.
- Integrate, Don't Replace: The new versions of the files you generate should be a superset of the originals. Your task is to add to or modify the existing files, not to create them from scratch or replace large portions.
- Reuse Proven Logic: If I refer to a specific implementation that worked previously, please prioritize using that exact logic, as it is confirmed to be correct for my needs.
- Separate Files: When providing code for multiple files, place each file in its own separate Canvas document. Do not combine the content of multiple files into a single document.
