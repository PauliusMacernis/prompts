Important Instructions for File Updates:

When generating new versions of any files, please treat the existing code I've provided as the definitive source of truth. Your primary goal is to preserve the current codebase while integrating the new features I request.

Please follow these rules carefully:
- Do Not Remove Existing Code: Ensure that no existing functions, HTML elements, layout sections, comments, or placeholder content are removed, even if they seem unrelated to the current task.
- Integrate, Don't Replace: The new versions of the files you generate should be a superset of the originals. Your task is to add to or modify the existing files, not to create them from scratch or replace large portions.
- Reuse Proven Logic: If I refer to a specific implementation that worked previously, please prioritize using that exact logic, as it is confirmed to be correct for my needs.
