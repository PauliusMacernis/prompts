1. “Find the cheapest way to fly from [City A] to [City B] next month, include hidden routes + alternate airports.”→ ChatGPT uncovers what Google overlooks.
2. “Which budget airlines operate this route that aren’t listed on Google Flights or Skyscanner?”→ About 26% of flights are invisible. Until now.
3. “Suggest layover cities that cut the price, even if it requires two separate bookings.”→ Split-ticketing = secret advantage.
4. “Any mistake fares, flash sales, or unusually cheap flights departing [my airport] this month?”→ Travel blogs lag behind. AI doesn’t.
5. “Compare this flight across all platforms, where is it cheapest right now?”→ One prompt replaces dozens of tabs.
6. “Monitor this route for 3 days, alert me if the price dips below $90.”→ Let AI watch. You just book.
7. “Can booking two one-ways beat the round-trip price? Check both.”→ The system isn’t perfect. Use it.
