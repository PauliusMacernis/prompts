I will provide each complete current version of the files provided in the new feature implementation, so you may confirm if the change has no regressions introduced. There must be improvements only, no previously existed features or important details dropped. What I also am not that happy about in regard to the change - it seems that some files are modified way too much, so reviewing the PR has been made unnecessary complex. For example, removing valuable comments just to make the file shorter, changing style of the same code, and alike adjustments make the PR review unnecessary too complex. If you spot any of these, lets adjust it, to make it so that the file would be changed as much as really needed for the feature to be implemented, and no unnecessary redundant changes introduced.

Now, lets do the review file by file. Lets do so: I upload the current version of the file, you audit it and if you see any issues then respond with the new version of the file. I change the code I have with the version of the file you have provided, and will pass you another file for the audit. And we do so until we review each of the files. I want to be sure this massive change does not introduce any bugs in prod, and is easy enough for the human to review for changes as well.

Lets start?
